There are countless resources to learn JavaScript, and that is both a bad and a good thing. The good thing is that we have many options to choose from. However, the bad thing is that we do not know which resource is the best.

Thus, the purpose of this article is to shine some light, and guide you towards the best resources to learn JavaScript. Especially as a beginner. Therefore, let us see the best resources.

The first resource on the list is FreeCodeCamp. FreeCodeCamp provides an excellent introduction to JavaScript. Moreover, it dives into advanced topics as well. It takes you from no knowledge to an intermediate level.

However, once you dive into the advanced topics, you might have to supplement the learning with additional resources. Or with their YouTube channel. By the way, talking about their YouTube channel, it is another excellent resource. They have many JavaScript tutorials created by professional developers.

Thus, you can get to an advanced level just by using the FreeCodeCamp platform and their YouTube channel.

# [](https://dev.to/codeloungedev/5-best-resources-to-learn-javascript-for-free-n53#you-dont-know-javascript)You Don’t Know JavaScript

The book series “You Don’t Know JavaScript” is one of the best resources to learn JavaScript, if not the best. This series is split into six books, and it takes you from zero knowledge to an advanced level. It teaches you about the scope, closures, “this” keyword, object prototype, types & grammar, async, performance, and ES6 & beyond.

The series is written by Kyle Simpson, who is a very knowledgeable person, and an active JavaScript developer. The good thing is that, like FreeCodeCamp, YDKJS series is free. Of course, you can, and you should buy them to support the author if you can afford it.

The “You Don’t Know JavaScript” series is my go-to manual. Whenever I want to refresh concepts or learn new ones, I use this resource first. It is well-written, detailed, to the point, and always following the ECMAScript specification.

Practising by building application yourself is critical in programming. As a result, I want to recommend you JavaScript30, which focuses exclusively on building JavaScript applications. It does not use any frameworks, compilers, boilerplates, and so on. It is purely vanilla JavaScript.

The JavaScript30 course is for beginners and intermediate. It is going to teach you the JavaScript fundamentals and how to work with the Document Object Model (DOM). Bear in mind; you should already have basic JavaScript knowledge before starting the course. The purpose of the course is to make you apply that knowledge.

JavaScript30 is entirely free, as well. Until this point, you have three excellent resources to skyrocket your JavaScript skills for free!

# [](https://dev.to/codeloungedev/5-best-resources-to-learn-javascript-for-free-n53#mdn-web-docs-javascript)MDN Web Docs JavaScript

MDN cannot miss from this article, as it is an excellent website. Thus, it is no surprise that their JavaScript tutorial is fantastic.

The online tutorial is split into four parts:

1. Complete beginners
2. JavaScript Guide
3. Intermediate
4. Advanced

As with the other resource listed in the article, you can go from a basic level to an advanced level. Besides that, the course is written and maintained by professional developers.

Therefore, you can bet on the tutorial provided by MDN. It is of the highest quality.

# [](https://dev.to/codeloungedev/5-best-resources-to-learn-javascript-for-free-n53#javascriptinfo)JavaScript.info

The last resource I want to mention is JavaScript.info, which is a superb website for reference. It contains information on basic JavaScript, advanced concepts, and Document Object Model.

The website is split into three parts:

1. **The JavaScript Language** – start from scratch and go on to advanced concepts like OOP. The focus is on the language itself here.
2. **Browser: Document, Events, Interfaces** – learn how to manage the browser page: add elements, manipulate their size and position, dynamically create interfaces and interact with the visitor.
3. **Additional Articles** – a list of extra topics that assume you’ve covered the first two parts of the tutorial. There is no clear hierarchy here; you can read articles in the order you want.

The information is dense, and to the point. You can use the website as your primary study guide, or you can use it in conjuncture with the other resources.

Check:

* [JavaScript.info](http://javascript.info/)
